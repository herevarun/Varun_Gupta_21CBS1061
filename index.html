  <h1>Languages Used</h1>
<p>
  I have used HTML and CSS on this website. HTML is a hypertext markup language, and CSS is a cascading style sheet. HTML is used to design the basic structure of the website, and CSS is used to give styles to the webpage.
</p>
<div class="htmlcss">
  <div class=" logo" style="background-image: url('htmllogo.png');" onmouseover="showtext('hc')" onmouseout="hidetext('hc')"></div>
  <div class=" logo" style="background-image: url('csslogo.png');" onmouseover="showtext('cc')" onmouseout="hidetext('cc')"></div>
  <div class=" logo" style="background-image: url('js.png');" onmouseover="showtext('jc')" onmouseout="hidetext('jc')"></div>


<div class="logocontent" id="hc">
  As a basic requirement of every website, this website makes use of HTML to build up the base for the website.

  </div>
<div class="logocontent" id="cc">
  This website makes use of styling as much as possible.
  grid,hover, transitions, and colour grading‚Äîalmost every aspect of CSS has been touched on in this website.
  </div>
<div class="logocontent" id="jc">
  This website contains a little bit of Javascript as well. For example, JS¬† is used for this hover or onmouseover effect.</div>
